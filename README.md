# First project using Javascript
https://ego-mejia.github.io/practice-JScourse/

I decided to learn Javascript from the basics as I tried coding with React environment and, although
I was able to replicate some functionalities, I wasn't able to understand what was the
difference from using JS vanilla vs React. 

Taking this course helped me realize how JS itself is incredible powerful and full of functionalities,
and React is a catalyzer, enhancing the features already existing in JS.

It was hard for me to accept that I wasn't able to understand and going back to learn the very basics,
but I decided to be humble and realistic because this process is about consistence not speed.

ðŸª² My funniest most frustrating bug was to spend a WHOLE day looking for a typo; It turned out it
was just a *space* in my CSS style sheet: .product-card .product-info {}
